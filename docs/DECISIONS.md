Decisions and library versions, newest first.

## 2026-11-06 — Task 1.1 scaffold
- **TypeScript held at 6.0.x (`~6.0.3`), not 7.0.** The current Vite template ships TypeScript 7.0.2, but `typescript-eslint` 8.72.1 (current) supports only `>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`, and the plan requires ESLint. Revisit when typescript-eslint supports TS 7.
- **ESLint, not oxlint.** The current `create-vite` template uses oxlint; the plan specifies ESLint, so ESLint 10 flat config is used with `typescript-eslint` strict, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (flat recommended), `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` (vite preset) and `eslint-config-prettier`. `npm run lint` runs ESLint then `prettier --check`.
- **Strict TypeScript**: `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, plus the template's unused/erasable-syntax checks.
- **Tailwind CSS 4** through the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (`@import 'tailwindcss'` in `src/index.css`); no `tailwind.config` file needed in v4.
- **Vitest** has its own `vitest.config.ts` merged over `vite.config.ts`, jsdom environment, `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` in `src/test/setup.ts`.
- **Playwright locally uses the installed Google Chrome** (`channel: 'chrome'`) so no browser binaries are downloaded onto the machine; CI installs Playwright's Chromium. E2E runs against `vite preview` on port 4173.
- **Line endings**: `.gitattributes` forces LF and `core.autocrlf=false` is set in this clone, so Prettier and Git agree on Windows.
- **GitHub repo** `TCannonx/airhead` (private) created through the REST API (`POST /user/repos`) with squash-only merges, auto-merge allowed and delete-branch-on-merge, which matches the `gh repo edit` flags in `CLAUDE.md`. A local hook blocks pushing to `main`, so the repo was created with GitHub's initial commit and the docs landed through PR #1.

## 2026-11-06 — Tooling on this machine
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed.** Repo creation, settings, PRs, check polling and merges use the GitHub REST API directly, with the token held by Git Credential Manager (`git credential fill`). Each `gh` command in `CLAUDE.md` maps to its REST equivalent (`POST /user/repos`, `PATCH /repos/{o}/{r}`, `POST /pulls`, `PUT /pulls/{n}/merge`, etc.). Auto-merge is done by polling check runs and merging only when all are green, which is equivalent to `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
- **Supabase CLI, Deno and Docker are not installed.** The Supabase CLI runs through `npx supabase`. Tests that need the local Supabase stack (RLS, SQL, Deno function tests) run in GitHub Actions, where Docker is available; CI is the gate for them.
- **npm runs from Git Bash**, because PowerShell's execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`.
- Git identity is repo-local: Thomas Cannon, GitHub noreply address (same as StatPadder).

## 2026-11-06 — Project location
- Project lives in personal OneDrive: `C:\Users\Thomas_Cannon\OneDrive\GitHub\airhead` (user requirement: nothing stored on the local machine outside OneDrive).
- `CLAUDE.md` at repo root; supplied `settings.json` placed at `.claude/settings.json` (project-level Claude Code settings).
